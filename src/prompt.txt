A young astronomer discovers an ancient constellation that begins to rearrange itself in the night sky. The scenes should have deep, rich night-time colors with the primary setting being a hilltop observatory. The astronomer has a well-worn leather journal and vintage brass telescope, while the moving stars glow with shifting purple and gold light. Style should be dramatic and atmospheric, blending realism with magical elements, maintaining consistent character and location details throughout.
