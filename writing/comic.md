: Use `image` Markdown tags to sequence your images to create
your overall narrative. These _may_ (should, kinda?) include some
gesture toward text -- even if placed on the images by the author
and not the generator.

This comic should include at _least_ `12` images. Bonus points (not
really, but you get the idea) for laying out or arranging a comic
format.
